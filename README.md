# DataAnalyticsCapstone
Capstone project for Google Data Analytics certificate course

This is a case study of the (fictional) Cyclistic bike-share company using publicly available date from the Divvy bike share program in Chicago. The data analyzed runs from May 2023 to April 2024 and is comprised of 5,738,612 individual data points. After cleaning the data 4,500,704 data points remained and the analysis was based on this data.

The goal of this scenario is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members by better understanding how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. 

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The product of this analysis is a report with the following deliverables:
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis
